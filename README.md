## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Hebrew reading teaching website designed specifically for my daughter, Ella. The website, [Ella-Ar Hebrew Learning](https://ella-ar.netlify.app/), aims to make the process of learning Hebrew fun and interactive.

- R Code for Generating Letter Images: The repository includes R scripts that generate images of each Hebrew letter with "Nikud" (Hebrew vowel signs). These images are crucial for teaching the various sounds each letter can make.
- Image Libraries:
  * Letter Images: Contains the generated images of Hebrew letters with different Nikuds
  * Related Images: A collection of images depicting objects or concepts that start with the corresponding Hebrew sounds. These serve as hints and visual aids in learning.
- JavaScript Interactivity: The site's interactivity is driven by JavaScript, enabling dynamic learning experiences.

## Key Functionalities:
- Toggle Difficulty: Users can switch between easy and hard modes, adjusting the learning experience.
- Nikud Selection: Allows for the selection of specific Nikuds to focus on.
- Letter and Nikud Display: Interactive display of letters and Nikuds.
- Hint Images: Visual aids to reinforce the learning of sounds and words.
